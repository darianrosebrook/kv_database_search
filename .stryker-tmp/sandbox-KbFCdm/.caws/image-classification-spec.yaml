title: "Image Classification and Scene Description for Multi-Modal Content"
risk_tier: 2
scope:
  in:
    - "Add image classification processor for scene understanding"
    - "Extract key frames from videos for classification"
    - "Generate descriptive captions for visual content"
    - "Combine OCR text extraction with scene descriptions"
    - "Enhance search with visual content understanding"
  out:
    - "Text-only image processing"
    - "No scene context for visual search"
invariants:
  - "OCR functionality remains unchanged and enhanced"
  - "Image classification is additive, not replacing existing features"
  - "Performance impact is configurable and optional"
  - "Scene descriptions are searchable alongside text content"
  - "Video processing includes frame extraction for classification"
acceptance:
  - id: A1
    given: "image with recognizable scene (meeting, diagram, etc.)"
    when: "processing with classification enabled"
    then: "scene description is generated and searchable"
  - id: A2
    given: "video without audio"
    when: "extracting key frames and classifying"
    then: "visual content is made searchable through scene descriptions"
  - id: A3
    given: "image with both text and scene"
    when: "processing with OCR + classification"
    then: "both text extraction and scene description are available"
  - id: A4
    given: "mixed content vault with images and videos"
    when: "searching for scene types"
    then: "results include visual content with scene understanding"
