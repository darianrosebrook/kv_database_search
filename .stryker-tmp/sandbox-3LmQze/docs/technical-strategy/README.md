# Technical Strategy & Implementation

This directory contains technical implementation strategies, architectural decisions, and roadmaps for system optimization.

## 📁 Contents

- **[Embedding Strategy](./EMBEDDING_STRATEGY.md)** - Comprehensive roadmap for improving semantic search through advanced embedding management

## 🎯 Purpose

These documents provide:
- **Technical Roadmaps**: Phased implementation plans for major features
- **Architecture Decisions**: Strategic choices and their rationale
- **Performance Optimization**: Systematic approaches to improving system performance
- **Scalability Planning**: Strategies for handling growth and increased load

## 🚀 Key Focus Areas

### Embedding Strategy
- **Multi-Model Support**: Using different embedding models for different content types
- **Quality Monitoring**: Continuous assessment of embedding effectiveness
- **Incremental Updates**: Efficient handling of content changes
- **Performance Optimization**: Balancing quality and speed

### Implementation Phases
1. **Foundation** - Multi-model infrastructure and basic strategy
2. **Quality Assurance** - Monitoring and optimization systems
3. **Advanced Features** - Hybrid search and personalization
4. **Production Infrastructure** - Scalable, monitored systems

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Performance Targets
- **Latency**: <100ms for cached queries, <500ms for new embeddings
- **Quality**: >80% of queries return relevant results in top 3
- **Scalability**: Support 10,000+ chunks with <2x performance degradation
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with automatic failover

### Quality Metrics
- **Relevance Score**: Average >0.75 for top results
- **User Satisfaction**: >90% of searches find what users need
- **Zero-Result Rate**: <5% of queries return no results
- **Cache Hit Rate**: >85% for repeat queries
