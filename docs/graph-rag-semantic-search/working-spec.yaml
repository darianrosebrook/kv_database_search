risk_tier: 2
scope:
  in: 
    - "Multi-modal content ingestion (PDFs, videos, audio, images, documents)"
    - "Entity extraction and relationship mapping from all content types"
    - "Knowledge graph construction from extracted entities"
    - "Hybrid vector + graph traversal search algorithms"
    - "Multi-hop reasoning for contextual query expansion"
    - "Cross-modal semantic search across all file types"

    - "Advanced graph algorithms (PageRank, community detection)"
    - "Multi-tenant knowledge graph isolation"

invariants:
  - "Search results must include provenance chain showing entity relationships"
  - "Knowledge graph consistency: entities have unique identifiers across content types"
  - "Vector embeddings and graph relationships must be synchronized"
  - "Search performance: P95 < 500ms for queries with ≤3 hops"
  - "Graph updates are atomic: either all entities/relationships succeed or none"
  - "Entity extraction confidence scores ≥ 0.7 for inclusion in knowledge graph"
