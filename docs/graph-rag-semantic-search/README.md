# Graph RAG-Enhanced Semantic Search System

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of a Graph RAG-enhanced semantic search system that combines vector similarity with knowledge graph traversal to provide contextually rich, explainable search results across all content types.

**Key Innovation**: Hybrid search that leverages both statistical similarity (vectors) and semantic relationships (knowledge graphs) to deliver more accurate and contextual results than traditional RAG systems.
