scope:
  in:
    - "Image processing and OCR extraction for visual content"
    - "Audio transcription for spoken content"
    - "Video processing with frame extraction and audio transcription"
    - "PDF document parsing with text and image extraction"
    - "Multi-language content detection and processing"
    - "Content type auto-detection and routing"
    - "Metadata extraction from all supported formats"
    - "Quality validation and error handling for all content types"
  out:
    - "Real-time streaming ingestion (out of scope for initial implementation)"
    - "Advanced OCR features like handwriting recognition"
    - "Video scene detection and semantic analysis"
    - "3D model processing and spatial reasoning"
    - "Live audio transcription during recording"
invariants:
  - "All ingested content maintains original metadata integrity"
  - "Processing pipeline handles content type detection with ≥95% accuracy"
  - "Memory usage remains ≤2GB per processing job"
  - "Processing latency ≤500ms per MB of content"
  - "Extracted text maintains ≥90% fidelity to original content"
  - "File corruption detection accuracy ≥99%"
  - "Content validation passes for ≥98% of valid files"
acceptance:
  - id: A1
    given: "mixed content vault with images, PDFs, audio files, and markdown"
    when: "unified ingestion pipeline processes all content types"
    then: "correctly extracts and indexes all content with appropriate metadata and embeddings"
  - id: A2
    given: "image file with embedded text and diagrams"
    when: "image processing pipeline runs OCR and metadata extraction"
    then: "extracts ≥90% of visible text and generates accurate content description"
  - id: A3
    given: "audio file with speech content in supported language"
    when: "audio transcription pipeline processes the file"
    then: "generates transcription with ≥85% word accuracy and timestamps"
  - id: A4
    given: "PDF document with mixed text and images"
    when: "PDF processing pipeline analyzes the document"
    then: "extracts text content with ≥95% accuracy and processes embedded images"
  - id: A5
    given: "multilingual content in supported languages (100+ languages)"
    when: "language detection and processing pipeline runs"
    then: "correctly identifies language and applies appropriate processing model"
  - id: A6
    given: "corrupted or invalid content file"
    when: "content validation pipeline processes the file"
    then: "detects corruption and reports specific validation errors without crashing"
non_functional:

    - "Processing pipeline accessible via REST API with proper error messages"
    - "Content type detection results announced in API responses"
    - "Processing status accessible through monitoring endpoints"
  perf:
    api_p95_ms: 500
  security:
    - "No client-side processing of sensitive content"
    - "All processing happens in secure, isolated containers"
    - "File type validation prevents malicious content execution"
    - "Content metadata sanitized to prevent data leakage"
