# üöÄ Obsidian RAG Enhancement Roadmap

This document outlines potential enhancements inspired by Neo4j GraphRAG patterns and multi-modal content processing capabilities.

## üìã Transferable Concepts from Neo4j Workshop

### üîó Multi-Source Data Integration
**Goal**: Extend system to ingest and correlate structured + unstructured data sources

**Description**: The Neo4j workshop demonstrates combining HRIS databases with resume documents. We could adapt this to integrate external knowledge sources (APIs, databases, structured documents) with our Obsidian vault.

**Requirements**:
- [ ] Design unified data ingestion pipeline for multiple source types
- [ ] Implement source metadata tracking and relationship mapping
- [ ] Create cross-source entity resolution
- [ ] Add data quality validation and conflict resolution

**Performance Considerations**:
- [ ] Research incremental indexing strategies
- [ ] Evaluate batch processing vs real-time ingestion trade-offs
- [ ] Test impact on search latency with mixed data sources

### üéØ Enhanced Entity Extraction
**Goal**: Improve knowledge graph construction from documents beyond basic tag clustering

**Description**: Neo4j's approach shows sophisticated entity extraction and relationship mapping. We could enhance our current tag-based clustering with named entity recognition, concept extraction, and richer relationship modeling.

**Requirements**:
- [ ] Implement NLP-based entity extraction (persons, organizations, concepts)
- [ ] Add relationship type classification (is-a, has-a, related-to, etc.)
- [ ] Create entity disambiguation and linking
- [ ] Build hierarchical concept clustering

**Performance Considerations**:
- [ ] Benchmark NLP processing overhead
- [ ] Research lightweight entity extraction models
- [ ] Evaluate caching strategies for extracted entities
- [ ] Test impact on index size and search speed

### üîç Graph Query Patterns
**Goal**: Add natural language to graph query translation capabilities

**Description**: The workshop shows natural language interfaces to graph databases. We could enhance our relationship discovery with more sophisticated graph traversal and query capabilities within our vector framework.

**Requirements**:
- [ ] Design natural language to relationship query mapping
- [ ] Implement graph traversal algorithms for relationship discovery
- [ ] Add multi-hop relationship finding
- [ ] Create query expansion based on graph patterns

**Performance Considerations**:
- [ ] Research graph traversal optimization techniques
- [ ] Evaluate pre-computed relationship indexes
- [ ] Test query complexity limits and timeouts
- [ ] Measure memory usage for graph operations
