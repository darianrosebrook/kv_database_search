## 10. Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Enable Quality Gates**: Mutation testing and coverage thresholds must be enforced
2. **Update Working Spec**: Reflect actual multi-modal scope and acceptance criteria
3. **Implement Missing Tests**: Accessibility, comprehensive E2E, and performance testing

### Process Improvements
1. **Enforce CAWS Loop**: Require feature plans and provenance for all changes
2. **Trust Score Integration**: Block merges below acceptable trust thresholds
3. **Documentation Standards**: Require operational docs for production features

### Architecture Considerations
1. **Scope Management**: Consider separate working specs for major feature additions
2. **Risk Tier Review**: Multi-modal complexity may warrant Tier 2+ requirements
3. **Contract Evolution**: Update API contracts to reflect multi-modal capabilities

## 11. Conclusion

The Obsidian Multi-Modal RAG system demonstrates strong engineering fundamentals and CAWS compliance in core areas (78/100 score). The codebase is well-structured, tested, and follows CAWS principles. However, significant gaps in quality assurance (mutation testing, accessibility, performance budgets) prevent production readiness at Tier 2 standards.

**Recommendation:** Address critical issues in Phase 1 before considering production deployment. The system shows excellent potential but requires completion of CAWS quality gates for engineering-grade reliability.

**Final Assessment:** Solid foundation with clear path to production readiness. Focus on automated quality gates and operational excellence to achieve full CAWS compliance.
