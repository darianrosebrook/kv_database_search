# Enhanced Entity Extraction

## Purpose
Improve knowledge graph construction beyond basic tag clustering by implementing sophisticated entity extraction, named entity recognition, and relationship mapping within the current vector-first architecture.

## Current State
- **Entity Detection**: Basic tag extraction from markdown
- **Relationships**: Wikilink parsing and tag co-occurrence
- **Knowledge Graph**: Simple tag-based clustering with basic centrality scoring

## Proposed Enhancements

### Entity Recognition
- **Named Entity Recognition**: Identify persons, organizations, concepts
- **Concept Extraction**: Extract key ideas and topics from content
- **Entity Disambiguation**: Resolve entity references across documents
- **Contextual Entities**: Understand entity roles and relationships

### Relationship Mapping
- **Semantic Relationships**: Beyond "related-to" (is-a, has-a, part-of)
- **Relationship Strength**: Weighted connections based on context
- **Multi-hop Reasoning**: Discover indirect relationships
- **Temporal Relationships**: Track how relationships evolve over time

### Knowledge Graph Features
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Organize concepts into taxonomies
- **Concept Similarity**: Semantic clustering beyond lexical matching
- **Centrality Analysis**: Identify key concepts and hubs
- **Graph Traversal**: Navigate relationships efficiently

## Performance Considerations
- **Processing Overhead**: NLP operations add computational cost
- **Storage Requirements**: Rich entity metadata increases storage needs
- **Query Complexity**: Graph operations may impact search speed
- **Incremental Updates**: Efficient reprocessing when content changes

## Success Metrics
- **Entity Coverage**: Percentage of content with extracted entities
- **Relationship Accuracy**: Precision/recall of relationship detection
- **Graph Connectivity**: Average path length between related concepts
- **Search Relevance**: Improvement in semantically related results

## Risk Assessment
**Tier**: 2 (Data writes, affects search quality)
**Impact**: Medium - enhances but doesn't break existing functionality
**Complexity**: Medium - requires NLP integration and graph algorithms

## Technical Approach

### Architecture Integration
```
Current Flow: Content → Tags → Basic Relationships
Enhanced Flow: Content → NLP Processing → Rich Entities → Advanced Relationships
```

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Incremental Enhancement**: Add NLP processing alongside existing tag extraction
2. **Fallback Support**: Maintain current functionality if NLP processing fails
3. **Configurable Depth**: Allow users to control processing intensity
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Track impact on ingestion and search performance

## Next Steps
1. Evaluate NLP libraries for TypeScript/Node.js
2. Prototype entity extraction on sample content
3. Measure performance impact and accuracy
4. Design integration with existing knowledge graph features
